          <h4>Technology has become such an important part of our lives. Without it, many of us, including myself, would have a difficult time surviving in our world.
          From the moment we wake up out of our bed, we need to go through our technological devices to understand what is going on between our friends, families, and the
          world. But at times, some of the news that is provided to us, espcially when it revolves around politics and the world, may have untrustworthy information in it.
          The biggest problem of this issue is that many of us do not even know that it is fake news. Well this is why this website has been created. On this website, you will learn
          and understand what fake news is and how you can identify it in articles, videos, and social media. After learning this, a quiz will be available for you to test your
          knowledge and understanding of fake news. </h4>
